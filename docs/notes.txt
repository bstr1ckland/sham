Under /sys/class/hwmon/,
There exists multiple hwmonX directories.
Each contain a "name" file that tells you what that directory corresponds to.
There is one for GPU, drive, CPU, etc.

hwmon0 = nvme
hwmon1 = amdgpu
hwmon2 = k10temp (cpu)
hwmon3 = nct6687 (do research)
hwmon4 = mt7921_phy0 (do research)

TODO: Look into making the temp reading functions all one, but pass in parameter for the file?

TODO: Set colour of temps to green, yellow, or red based on the temp + load
